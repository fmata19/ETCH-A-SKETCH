# ETCH-A-SKETCH
From the Odin Curriculum, ETCH-A-SKETCH is browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. This web app allows you to draw anything you'd like by simply hovering over the canvas. You can also clear the canvas to get a fresh grid and select how large the pixels will be.
